It is a project where you can watch the image, can upload the picture and also add some filters on it. This is a React Redux project, also I'm using Filestack to upload the images.
The development of this project is following this tutorial:

The intention on this project is to learn more about React and Redux paradigm

If you clone or download the project remember install dependencies

Another tip to make the project works, you have to sign in https://www.filestack.com/
once that, check the API Key, this API KEY have to be put on the index.js code

```
